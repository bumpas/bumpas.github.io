I remember fondly piling into the car as a kid, the chill of winter air mixing with the excitement of seeing colorful lights twinkling on houses. All the different arrangements, colors and sometimes even music. \n\nLights on a house at night have a kind of common magic. But still you have a subset of lights. Maybe a handful of different bulbs, string types, colors etc. Yet some displays hit you like a small, brilliant surprise. That feeling is what I mean by originality: for the majority only a handful of similiar items, but a human arrangement and creativity that makes each display unique.\n\nAI isn’t just a creative assistant; it can also be a sameness machine.\n\nThink about the rise of app-driven LED strings — the same preset palettes, the same gobos and chase patterns distributed by default in companion apps. Brands like Govee make it easy to load a handful of popular patterns and share them. That’s great for convenience, but when thousands of people choose the same presets, the neighborhood loses the small variations that used to make displays feel local.\n\nWhen creativity is reduced to “pick a preset,” originality suffers. An algorithm trained on the most liked or most shared patterns will recommend what’s already popular. Optimization amplifies conformity. The result: houses that technically glow beautifully but emotionally read as uniform.\n\nThis effect shows up in other places too — social feeds, stock photo libraries, even AI-generated art marketplaces. If the reward signal favors familiarity, creators (and buyers) are nudged toward safe choices. With decorative lighting, the stakes are small but visible: a walk down any block at night starts to feel like a showroom rather than a neighborhood.\n\nThat doesn’t make AI or smart lights the enemy. They’re tools that can either flatten or free up creativity depending on how you use them. Here’s a short approach to avoid the trap:\n\n- Resist the first preset. Choose a raw color or two and tweak spacing, timing, or placement manually.\n- Add a constraint tied to your home — a roofline quirk, a sentimental ornament, or a favored color that has meaning for you.\n- Share oddness, not just polish. If you like a weird combination, it’s worth keeping; those choices are what shift the visible taste.\n\nIf we want our streets to feel alive, someone has to opt out of the default. That small refusal — leaving a preset off, running a slightly awkward string of vintage bulbs, or twining lights around a crooked post — is how originality survives in an era of perfectly optimized patterns.\n\n{/* Placeholder images: replace with real photos of Christmas lights on houses at night */}\n\n{/* Placeholder images: replace with real photos of Christmas lights on houses at night */}\n![Christmas lights on houses at night](/images/post/christmas-lights-1.jpg)\n![Close-up bokeh of bulbs](/images/post/christmas-lights-2.jpg)","src/content/posts/christmas-lights.mdx","71042daaf4c908f6","homepage",["Map",113,114],"-index",{"id":113,"data":115,"filePath":125,"digest":126,"rendered":127,"legacyId":137},{"banner":116,"call_to_action":119},{"title":117,"image":118},"Ever Curious.\u003Cbr/> Front-end Engineer. \u003Cbr/>Design Systems.\u003Cbr/> Eats Ambiguity For Breakfast.
