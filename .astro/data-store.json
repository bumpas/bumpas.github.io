What This Site Collects\n\n**1.1 Information You Share**\nIf you choose to get in touch (like through a contact form or email), you might share things such as:\n- Your name  \n- Your email address  \n- Whatever message you send along  \n\nThat’s it — no hidden data collection or sign-ups here.\n\n**1.2 Automatic Info**\nLike most websites, some basic technical info is automatically collected to keep things running smoothly, such as:\n- Which pages you visit  \n- Your browser and device type  \n- Rough location (city or region)  \n- How you found the site (like through Google or social media)  \n\nThis data is anonymous and helps me understand how people use the site so I can make it better.\n\n## 2. How the Information Is Used\n\nAny information collected is used only to:\n- Respond if you reach out  \n- Improve site content or performance  \n- Keep an eye on general traffic trends  \n\nYour info will **never be sold, traded, or shared** with anyone else for marketing or advertising purposes.  \n\n## 3. Cookies & Analytics\n\nThis site may use tools like **Google Analytics** or similar services to see how people use the site — things like page views and visit duration.  \nThese tools use cookies (small text files stored in your browser) to collect that info.  \n\nYou can clear or disable cookies anytime in your browser settings — the site will still work just fine.\n\n## 4. Third-Party Services\n\nandrewbumpas.com may rely on a few trusted services to function, like:\n- A web hosting provider (for storing and serving the site)  \n- Google Analytics (for anonymous traffic stats)  \n\nThese third parties have their own privacy policies, and they only collect what’s needed to provide their services.\n\n## 5. Data Security\n\nReasonable steps are taken to keep your information safe, but please remember that no website or online service can guarantee absolute security.\n\n## 6. Children’s Privacy\n\nThis site isn’t aimed at children under 13, and no personal information is knowingly collected from them.\n\n## 7. Updates to This Policy\n\nThis Privacy Policy may be updated occasionally as the site evolves. Any changes will be reflected here with a new “last updated” date.\n\n## 8.
