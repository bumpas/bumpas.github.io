_Last updated: October 15, 2025_

Hey there — thanks for visiting **andrewbumpas.com**.  
Your privacy matters, and I want to be upfront about what kind of information this site collects, how it’s used, and how it’s kept safe.

## 1. What This Site Collects

**1.1 Information You Share**
If you choose to get in touch (like through a contact form or email), you might share things such as:

- Your name
- Your email address
- Whatever message you send along

That’s it — no hidden data collection or sign-ups here.

**1.2 Automatic Info**
Like most websites, some basic technical info is automatically collected to keep things running smoothly, such as:

- Which pages you visit
- Your browser and device type
- Rough location (city or region)
- How you found the site (like through Google or social media)

This data is anonymous and helps me understand how people use the site so I can make it better.

## 2. How the Information Is Used

Any information collected is used only to:

- Respond if you reach out
- Improve site content or performance
- Keep an eye on general traffic trends

Your info will **never be sold, traded, or shared** with anyone else for marketing or advertising purposes.

## 3. Cookies & Analytics

This site may use tools like **Google Analytics** or similar services to see how people use the site — things like page views and visit duration.  
These tools use cookies (small text files stored in your browser) to collect that info.

You can clear or disable cookies anytime in your browser settings — the site will still work just fine.

## 4. Third-Party Services

andrewbumpas.com may rely on a few trusted services to function, like:

- A web hosting provider (for storing and serving the site)
- Google Analytics (for anonymous traffic stats)

These third parties have their own privacy policies, and they only collect what’s needed to provide their services.

## 5. Data Security

Reasonable steps are taken to keep your information safe, but please remember that no website or online service can guarantee absolute security.

## 6. Children’s Privacy

This site isn’t aimed at children under 13, and no personal information is knowingly collected from them.

## 7. Updates to This Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated occasionally as the site evolves. Any changes will be reflected here with a new “last updated” date.

## 8. Contact

If you have any questions about how your information is handled, just reach out:
